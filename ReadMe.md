# Character Tables

This project contains a set of Unicode character tables that show various character sets, plus a Swift script that generates a character table.  The reason I wrote the script is to generate the first table, a [list of characters for Swift custom operators](operators.md).

* [Swift Operator Head](operators.md)
* [Unicode Letters](letters.md)
* [Unicode Punctuation](punctuation.md)
* [Unicode Symbols](symbols.md)

The Swift program has a [GPL3 license](License.md).  The generated files are public domain.
